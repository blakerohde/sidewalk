Why Sidewalk?
-------------

Sidewalk allows you to trigger the execution of Python methods from the command-line.

As the saying goes, there are many ways to skin a cat. Obviously people have been executing python code one way or another via command-line through methods of "python -c", or pointing directly to a Python file and using the "'__name__' == '__main__'" convention, etc.

When you register an activity processor, you assign it a key. You can create group associations when assigning keys (e.g. 'group.sub-group.activity_processor'). You can then execute all of the registered activity processors in one call by referencing the assigned 'group' or 'group.sub-group'. This is a nice feature as it allows you to execute many activity processors, that are potentially located in any number of modules, in one call.

You can also execute any number of groups, and/or any number of specific activity processors, when calling ``sidewalk-pave.py``. This is a key feature of Sidewalk, as you can easily create multiple cron job entries that run at various times, but call different activity processors. If you wanted to implement similar functionality in a traditional sense, you would have to create multiple modules that reference said activity processors, or create one module and have an if-else statement to do the same.
